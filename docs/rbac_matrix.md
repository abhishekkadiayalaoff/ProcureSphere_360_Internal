## 3. Object-Level Scoping Rules

- **Requester**: Restricted to items created by user or owned by user's assigned Department / Cost Center.
- **Vendor User**: Enforced at database selector level (`Vendor.objects.filter(id=user.vendor_id)`). Bids from competing vendors return `403 Forbidden` / filtered out at ORM query level.
- **Approver**: Restricted to requisitions/POs currently assigned in approval chain or department scope.
- **Auditor**: Global read-only access; state-changing endpoints return `403 Forbidden`.

## 4. Procurement Executive — Sourcing & Vendor Governance (action level)

Enforced server-side in `apps/sourcing/permissions.py`, `apps/vendors/permissions.py`, `apps/scorecards/permissions.py`, and re-checked in the services for governance status changes and risk assessments.

| Supplier scorecards (view / calculate) | `/scorecards/`, `/scorecards/calculate/`, `/api/v1/scorecards/` | ✔ / ✔ | ✔ / ✔ | R | R | – | Own (API) | Stores R; others none |

Object-level rules: vendor users are scoped by `user.vendor_id` in every queryset (cross-vendor IDs return 404). Draft events are never exposed to vendors, even invited ones. Status fields are read-only in every serializer; state changes go only through explicit POST actions backed by transition tables (`SOURCING_TRANSITIONS`, `VENDOR_GOVERNANCE_TRANSITIONS`).
